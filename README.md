# Vimrc

A set of my configuration files for Vim text editor. This is a compilation of
many different configs I made for myself over the long time since I was
introduced to Vim in the year 2002. All gathered together, cleaned up and
updated. It's my oldest and longest evolving work I've ever published!

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Working Git installation available from command line is necessary.

### Windows

Clone the whole repository into `~/vimfiles` directory:

    git clone https://github.com/mikomatyk/vimrc ~/vimfiles

### Linux

Clone the whole repository into `~/.vim` directory:

    git clone https://github.com/mikomatyk/vimrc ~/.vim

That's it, done!

## Optional settings

### Important

* All the following scripts must be run from `~/vimfiles` (Windows) or `~/.vim`
  (Linux).
* Existing files are overwritten without warning, and no backup is made.

### Polish spellcheck dictionary

To install Polish spellcheck dictionary, run the following script:

    polish_spell

This script will download Polish [Hunspell][01] dictionary from the
[LibreOffice][02] repository and then convert it into local
`./spell/pl.utf-8.spl` file that is suitable for Vim's spellchecker.

### Retrobox color scheme

If you are forced to use older version of Vim that does not contain `retrobox`
color scheme, you can install it by running the script:

    retrobox_scheme

This will download and locally install `retrobox` color scheme for you. Keep in
mind, that in some really ancient Vim versions `retrobox` would not work anyway.

### Shell scripts indentation tuning

To disable indenting of case label in Shell scripts code, run the following
script:

    shell_indent

This script will create a local copy of the Vim Shell indent file, and modify it
so that `case` label in Shell scripts are no longer indented. Reverting to the
original default behavior is as simple as deleting the local `./indent/sh.vim`
file.

### Smart tabs

To make Vim use tabs for code indentation and spaces for alignment, run the
following script:

    smart_tabs

This script downloads and locally installs the [Smart Tabs][00] plugin made by
Michael Geddes. Although this plugin has not been maintained for many years, it
still works for me.

### Install / Update

You can install all the above optional files by running the single script
wrapping everything together:

    install_all

It will also update any files already present.
